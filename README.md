This is the readme file for the fitness goal portal

## Description

The purpose of the project was to create a function that would check if there are any duplicate goals being added and if there are to display an alert to the user and if not procced to adding the new goal to the goal list

## Design Choices and Functionality

To achieve this I firstly retrived all existing goals in the goals list

The procceded to iterate through this list to see if it matches the new goals list

After which i used an if statement to check if there are any duplicates and if there are any to alert the user and if not to proceed to adding the goal to the goalList.
